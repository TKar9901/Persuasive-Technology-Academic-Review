themes:
- risks and limitations of algorithms
	- addiction (think social media)
	- inequality/ social bias (think credit scoring/ insurance/facial recog)
	- overcompensation (think EDI in hiring)
	- popularity vs. actual/ informative value (think personalized news feeds)
	- autonomous vehicles (discrimination, moral bias)
	- advertisements across the web (invasion of privacy)
	- recommendations categorising users (e-commerce & entertainment)
	
- downstream effects of bias in algorithms
	- mental health
	- reinforcing of bad habits

- definition of harm
	- how it can be calculated & measured
	- calculate different harm senarios via causal modelling
	- what is always missed out when modelling
	- difficult to measure


breakdown of attitudes:
	- mental attitudes
		- addiction (bad habits)
		- unhealthy dependency on others opinions (eg. self-image issues)
	- social attitudes
		- social bias
		- stereotypes
	- political attitudes
		- voting
		- polarization on certain issues
		- passiveness in the face of fake news
		

elliot: algorithmic influence on mental health & personal attitudes
- the bad habits theme
- addiction on social media
- overconsumption/ overspending in e-commerce & entertainment
- mental health & self-image

me: algorithmic influence on social and political attitudes
- social bias & stereotypes - cultural vs. scientific interpretation
- polarization/ politicization of certain issues - echo chambers across the web
- measures poorly defined -> cultural/ethical/personal "bias"
- popularity vs. actual/ informative value (think personalized news feeds & deep fakes and what we consider trustworthy information now vs before the internet)

- breakdown of different parts of algorithms and the inherent bias stemming from their structure
- useful for talking about similarities between algorithms in different domains (conceptual level - need to use examples to make points about human impact)

- case study on algorithm used in social media and showed less time spent online (addiction point) using reverse-chronologically ordered feeds
- over 3 months study showed little effect on issue polarization, affective polarization, political knowledge

- prevalence of echo-chambers on social media and how they inform voters opinions - study on 2020 US election
- multi-wave field experiment -> reducing exposure to certain content but did not yield "measurable effects on eight preregistered attitudinal measures"
- general alternative argument against effect of algorithms on social/ political attitudes
